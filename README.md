# LXY

A command-line tool for application of contact genomic data to the problems of genome scaffolding, phasing, and clustering.

## Features

* __Genome Scaffolding__: Scaffolding of genomes is performed, leveraging Hi-C contact genomic sequence data
* __Haplotype Phasing__:  Uses Hi-C data to reconstruct long-distance haplotypes
* __High Performance__:  A hybrid of python and Go to enable fast, concurrent processing

## Getting Started
